#### Introduction of project-hub
Hello! Thank you for visiting and I am glad you are here. 

This repository is a central hub to my projects, providing an overview of what I have worked on and what I am currently exploring. 

#### Project Overview

- Data Engineering Foundations 
    - [data_engineering_projects](https://github.com/leanya/data_engineering_projects)
        - A collection of foundational data engineering projects inspired by the Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree, including work with relational databases, NoSQL systems, and Airflow pipelines
    - [airflow_deployment](https://github.com/leanya/airflow_deployment)
        - Incremental data loading using Airflow
        - Focus: Airflow, scheduling, automation

- Machine Learning and Experimentation
    - mlflow
        - A machine learning experimentation project that track runs, tune parameters and compare models
        - Focus: MLflow

- BBC News Headlines Data Engineering Series
    - This series started out as an batch processing app to scrape, clean, and store news headlines daily for visualisation using Docker Compose on EC2. It extended to include  AWS infrastructure provisioning and app health monitoring, followed by deployment using Kubernetes and Helm. A real-time streaming version of the app was also developed

        - Core batch processing pipeline
        - Focus: PostgreSQL, Streamlit, Docker Compose, CI/CD
    - [batch_processing_bbc_infra](https://github.com/leanya/batch_processing_bbc_infra) 
        - Infrastructure provisioning and monitoring
        - Focus: Terraform, Prometheus, Grafana, Docker Compose, CI/CD
    - [batch_processing_bbc_kubernetes](https://github.com/leanya/batch_processing_bbc_kubernetes)
        - Kubernetes and Helm Deployment
        - Focus: Container Orchestration, Kubernetes, Helm, CI/CD
